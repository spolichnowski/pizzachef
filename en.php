    "full_intro" => "You know? Unlike most <i>Master Pizzaioli</i> and <i>Instruttori</i>, I did not learn to make pizza from my grandmother when I was five years old. I did not grow up in one of those noisy districts of an Italian city which smells of coffee and <i>cornetti</i> in the morning. As a twelve-year-old, I did not carry sacks of flour to the neighbourhood pizzeria. I was a young and poor Slav, who ate his first pizza when he was seventeen.</p><p>
                Not in Italy, but in a Polish city – the name of which I will not mention as I’d rather forget it myself! The pizza seemed to be good, even though none of its details are stuck in my memory. Anyway, in the eighties, the very fact I was in such a place and eating pizza was so attractive and absorbing that the details did not play any role. At least for me. And 'dark ages' lasted from time to time interspersed  by  places chosen 
                subconsciously, where I could feel like Italian because of the meal. I lived in this total unconsciousness for 25 years, wandering from city to city and eating better or worse... During this time, I was working for corporation ideologies and idols dressed in expensive neckties. On the way I even bought a few myself as well... after all these 'medieval' years, I rubbed my eyes one day and visited a second hand clothing shop. 
                Between the hundreds of clothes smelling of dust, I chose a completely new style suit; I bought a beautiful chef's jacket for five euros, trousers for two euros, and an apron for one euro. Later, I borrowed crocks shoes from my son, threw everything into a linen bag and went on foot for my first date. Somewhere in the basement, near the boiler room, I changed into my ‘old’ new outfit, walked on the first floor and began my adventure. An adventure with a pizza.
                </p><p>Like a soldier crawling in a muddy training ground, day after day, I was discovering my new world... Flour, water, oil, container, fridge, axe and blocks of wood... sink... mop... sink ... flour, water... After challenging theoretical and practical tests, I passed first time and received my certificate (no other has given me as much joy in my life as this!)
                After this, I got on a plane to Ireland and after two hours, the second day of one of those spring months, which wakes the desire to live in a man, I landed on Dublin airport.</p><p>
                During these two years I saw Edinburgh's windy airport, a cold Scottish winter, a beautiful Yorkshire railway station, a surprisingly very sunny summer, and a small autumn station in Sudbury with no rain for the longest time in many years... And everywhere pizza... No, not at airports and stations, but in authentic pizzerias. Sardinians, Sicilians, Neapolitans, Milanese. 
                They were everywhere, as are my countrymans... They were teaching me their treasure. They also paid a little. Italians, Irish, Scots, English. It was variously what I will write
                <a style=\"color: #DBA24A !important;\" href=\"http://www.ppolichnowski.pl\">here</a>, but finally all this time was in every respect extremely tasty and colourful. Places, landscapes, climate, people, their different cultures and characters, stories suitable for film scenarios, extraordinary and ordinary days. Adventure and creative passion, far far away from the “medieval“ darkness...
                </p><p>Some ask me if I'm crazy ... and I answer: Yes! I just love the journey. Although flour gets in the eyes and the water in the shoes sometimes... I love to make pizza, although this love was born in pain and is difficult to this day. In contrast to all those <i>Pizzaiolos</i> who, with the help of their grandmothers or various organizations, do it throughout their lives - and are the fastest, 
                the best - so their 'best pizza' is sometimes amazing, I do not know everything about it and I really doubt I would ever know. Even if I spent thousands of euros for training fees... That's my attitude. To discover. Every day I am discovering new flavours and their combinations, every day I experience how sensitive the craft is, how much care must be taken to get tastiest colours... This is pizza. 
                Seemingly nothing big. A thin, yeast cake with tomatoes and cheese. However, working with it and truly discovering it are details, lots of details. She can be beautifully round, colourful and tasty, but if you upset her, she will show you what means to be <i>capriccioso</i>... I want to share it all. Maybe to earn some money along the way. Together, like partners, something for something ... So regardless of when you started with her, write or call - let's discuss. 
                I advise on business and I solve technological and technical issues. I can join in every step of the planning, organizing or running process. I do not theorize. I work side by side with my clients and their teams, creatively looking for definition and value in their business, calculating costs, preparing recipes, rotating pizzas in the oven, washing and tidying the kitchen. It can be only busy, tasty, interesting and effective.",

                Well, 'there is something in it,' as said one sociologist who I know  ... I mean, such tendencies are in a man, to lose himself one way, or, more or less, a consciously manoeuvring between having and being. It’s natural.</p><p>
                I think what’s important is the beginning. Without the unnecessary idealization of dozens of methods and types of strategies, you have to know what you want to give people. Know the value of what you offer. Another point is that you should know for whom and how. And someone, what means the customer, must accept it ... Later is pretty much downhill. It is enough to choose the right team and with specific resources and acting in a certain way, to balance between the cost stream and the river of revenues ...</p><p>
                Yes, I rely on business models, which in my opinion minimally bore with theory and allow you to effectively, creatively, and very practically engage in creating the vision of our business, regardless of its size. They have one more distinguishing feature, because they allow you to build and understand the importance and dependencies between business worlds. The relationship between frontstage and backstage and our role in all of this. The role of the owner - the visionary - the creator - the coordinator.</p><p>
                So to the board! To define your business, to define our client, get to know him and to offer him real value. To transform all these boring tables into efficiently functioning everyday tools. To combine them in a mechanism that, with a little bit of everyday effort, will make our 'twisted' world more predictable and, ultimately, more profitable.</p>",

                The mixer and the oven in your pizzeria are your two biggest and best friends 
                (by the way, the most expensive too). But with them it is like with the budget tables ... 
                You have to fill them with content, knowledge and understanding of what they have to do for us, 
                because without it, even those which represent the highest shelf, they will become only a useless 
                object, an exhibit, and after all they have to work for you many years. For me, the technology 
                at the pizzeria begins with knowledge about flour. Get to know her, fall in love with her, start 
                to understand her, and I assure you that together you will create an unbeatable duet. When the water 
                will join you and the temperature will be right, a new life will start, il lievito madre, and your 
                friendly mixer will then be able to enter his role of a positive 'swindler' and form a dough for you. 
                His billets, panetti, ripening in favorable conditions, will delight with their velvet texture and 
                elasticity. It works. Just like the technique of forming a pizza, putting it in the oven, rotating it 
                during baking, even if the edge is two or three centimeters from the burning piece of wood and taking 
                it out at the moment where it has achieved the best quality. You just need to have a minimum of knowledge, 
                take time to exercise and have patience, because sometimes, well, it will hurt ...
                </p><p>
                These practical activities and continuous training never end, or at least they should not. After a while, 
                if you really want to do it, they become a standard and a pleasure for you and your Pizzaiolos. When you 
                are changing the menu, when you are visiting a trade fair and coming back to your pizzeria with a head full 
                of ideas, when new products appear on the market, it is worth to meet at a common table, to prepare something, 
                and simply to test it and to talk about it, to criticize and to rave about and make choices. It is good to 
                browse catalogues and small textbooks, refresh them from time to time, because the market does not like 
                stagnation, and your clients, like you, want to test and to have the opportunity to choose. Despite all the 
                tradition, pizza, and knowledge about it, lives like the whole world today: it very quickly and creatively 
                develops and follow new trends. Everything to impress not only with colour, taste, but also with a more 
                advanced, effective, less expensive production technique. Ultimately, what you do is the passion of creating entwined with the business ...</p>",

                To tell the truth, I have a dilemma. Because with all my respect and excitement for Italian ingredients, 
                I adhere to the principle that the kitchen, even the most characteristic one, when it is crossing borders 
                and the oceans, entering stealthily or officially into the recesses of our tastes and traditional habits, 
                can and should undergo certain modifications. Not only because of human preferences, but also because of the 
                frequent absurdity in which a cheese produced in the north of the country is best sold in the south and vice 
                versa ... I believe in localism and its success, and then in the cooperation between them and finally in 
                interpenetration of national cultures which having respect for local habits so beautifully enrich our lives, 
                making its moments special and festive.</p><p>
                I admit that despite my technological experiments and unchanging faith in the development force of domestic 
                producers and breeders, there are ingredients like Italian farina tipo 00 or pomodoro pelati, or spicy spianata or n'duja sausage, which 
                as an absolute and indisputable base have no substitutes . But pancetta, bresaola, coppa or salsiccia will already find their 
                counterparts in really good quality and quite a decent price... Why not try? Local breweries have started to deal with it perfectly 
                and today no one needs to be convincing that their products, unlike mass ones, have a taste ... Let's talk to our neighbours, small 
                producers of cold meats, vegetables, fruits, cheeses. Such business coalitions make sense.
                </p><p>
                Always, we have to work out the practical suggestions about the basic ingredients. They depend on the character of your pizzeria, 
                its size and its storage capacity, what method you produce, or how you want to produce the dough and how much you prepare every day.</p><p>
                Additives, regardless of their source and method of preparation, should always be and as fresh as possible. Without this rule, it's a pity to 
                start or continue the adventure with pizza and gastronomy. It's a great art to compose a menu in such a way that stock will be 
                as small as possible, and the offer of your pizzeria attractive enough. There are a few simple rules and using them it is worth 
                longer to work on it, using the list of mentioned local producers, opinions of your clients and yours team creative abilities. 
                It's worth it, because the final product, your pizza, is to smell and tempt, to stimulate conversation and discussion, addicting, 
                conjuring up smiles and make people happier. Is not always so ... I'm not going to criticize anyone, because I think with a pizza is 
                like with art according to J. Duda-Gracz, who used to say that every creator must be respected for his work, for his willingness to be an artist... 
                When, however, it comes to tell about our painting, offer it to others, earn money on it, it's another matter...</p>",
